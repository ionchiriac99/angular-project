	<a routerLink="/tic-tac-toe">Tic-tac-toe</a> (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs
	and Os (Canadian or Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a
	three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical,
	or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
